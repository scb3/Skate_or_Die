# Skate_or_Die
 A "website" made with simple to intermediate CSS

I made this website as a challenge to create a "Store Front/ Fan site" for skateboarding enthusiasts, right now it is only the main home page but does contain some more complex CSS such as Carosuls and Modals

TODO:

Build website as a "Fully Functional Site"
Add in more pages
Keep consistant Style
